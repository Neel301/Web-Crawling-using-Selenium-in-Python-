# Web-Crawling-using-Selenium-in-Python

- The selenium package is used to automate web browser interaction from Python. It supports various browsers like Chrome, Mozilla, Firefox, Safari, and IE, and you can very easily automate browser testing across these browsers using Selenium WebDriver.

Implementation is very easy. I have used here Conda environment.
